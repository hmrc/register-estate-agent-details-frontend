# Register estate agent details frontend

This service is responsible for collecting information about the agent who is registering an estate.

To run locally using the micro-service provided by the service manager:

***sm2 --start ESTATES_ALL***

If you want to run your local copy, then stop the frontend ran by the service manager and run your local code by using the following (port number is 8826 but is defaulted to that in build.sbt).

`sbt run`
